# Dot Files
Dot files used across all my macOS installs. They're expected to be installed through [strap](https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid/strap).

# Configuration

- `KEEP_XCODE_PREFERENCES=YES` prevents strap from overriding the preexisting Xcode preferences.
- `KEEP_VSCODE_PREFERENCES=YES` prevents strap from overriding the preexisting VS Code preferences.
- `SSH_KEY_EMAIL=<email>` sets a custom email for the generated SSH key.

# Manual Steps
1. Import iTerms color themes & profile.

# License
