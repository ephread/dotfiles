# Dot Files
Dot files used across all my macOS installs. They're expected to be installed through [strap](https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid/strap).

On Apple Silicon, run strap through `arch`:

```
$ /usr/bin/arch -x86_64 /bin/bash -c strap.sh
```

# Manual Steps
1. Import iTerms color themes & profile.
2. Change Spotlight's shortcut to **⇧⌘Space**.
